# ProjectNYSE Overview 
### Overview
Of the given NYSE database, this project highlights the total revenue for 33 companies within the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sector for Year 1.
### Findings
The bar graph is indicative of a right, or positively-skewed dataset. On average, the data points deviate from the mean ($42B) by about $84B which is the calculated standard deviation. The minimum in revenue is $1.5M and maximum is $469B for all companies. The range is estimated equal to the maximum earnings, but the bar chart illustrates a substantial variation in earnings across all companies with Walmart contributing significantly to the total revenue making up 34% between all 33 companies.
